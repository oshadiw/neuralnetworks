# neuralnetworks

  The purpose of this project was to create a machine learning model to predict the success of a venture funded by Alphabet Soup. Once the data was encoded and standardized, the deep neural network model was used. Initially, two layers were used with 8 and 5 nodes, and the activation function for the output layer was sigmoid adn 100 epochs. However, the model accuracy was only 53%, which falls short of the target accuracy score of 75%. I then tried optimizing the model by increasing the number of nodes to 10 and 7 with 150 epochs, but the accuracy remained at 53%. Finally, I added another layer with 5 nodes but was unable to achieve the target model performance. The SVM deep learning model might work better with this data since it uses geometric boundaries to distinguish data into two seperate groups.
